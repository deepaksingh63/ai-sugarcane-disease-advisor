AI Sugarcane Disease Advisor

AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection & Advisory System

📌 Project Summary (ATS Optimized)

AI Sugarcane Disease Advisor is a full-stack artificial intelligence application designed to detect sugarcane crop diseases using deep learning image classification and provide actionable agricultural advisory.
The system integrates Machine Learning, Computer Vision, REST APIs, and Web Technologies to support smart and data-driven farming.

🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers often face:

Late detection of crop diseases

Lack of expert agricultural guidance

Yield loss due to delayed treatment

This project addresses these challenges by enabling early disease identification through AI-based image analysis and decision-support recommendations.

⚠️ ML Model Management (Industry Best Practice)

Trained ML model files (.h5, .pt, .pkl) are excluded from GitHub

Models are loaded from external cloud storage

Prevents large file issues and supports production deployment

✔️ This follows real-world ML engineering and DevOps practices
